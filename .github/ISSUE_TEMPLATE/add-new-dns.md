**Name and a link to the DNS provider**
e.g. Google DNS https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns

**Check beforehand that the DNS provider has IPv6 support.**
DNS providers that do not have IPv6 support will not be included in this repo.

**Submit own DNS**
If you want to submit your own PIHole etc. you have to make sure that it is reachable and has an IPv6. Furthermore you should write a small text why I should include your dns server
